## Requirements

PHP: PHP 7.2 or higher

Magento: Magento 2.3.0 or higher

PHPStan: PHPStan 1.9

If you are using a Magento version that requires an older version of PHPStan (e.g. 0.12.77),  you need to manually upgrade it before 
installing this extension. in your composer.json Change the PHPStan version to `~1.9` and run:

```
composer update phpstan/phpstan --with-all-dependencies
```

This PHPStan extension needs to be registered with PHPStan so that the extension gets loaded properly. The easiest way to do this is 
to install the `phpstan/extension-installer` package as follows:

```
composer.phar require --dev phpstan/extension-installer
```

  <summary>Composer Allow-PLugins configuration</summary>

If you're using Composer >= 2.2.0 you have to allow the execution of composer plugins ([see allow-plugins section](https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#allow-plugins)) as follows:

```
  - Installing phpstan/extension-installer (1.1.0): Extracting archive
phpstan/extension-installer contains a Composer plugin which is currently not in your allow-plugins config. See https://getcomposer.org/allow-plugins
Do you trust "phpstan/extension-installer" to execute code and wish to enable it now? (writes "allow-plugins" to composer.json) [y,n,d,?] y
```

</details>
